# Investigation-of-the-reasons-for-a-dip-in-user-engagement

**This study was aimed at determining what may have led to the decrease in user engagement in August and offering workable solutions or suggestions for next steps.**
- We decided the dip was primarily caused by two factors - low quality new users (unfinished registrations) and a drop in engagement among active users as a result of vacations.
- Additionally, we recommended the following:
   a. Consider making the app more user-friendly by adding new features.
   b. Check the latest iOS updates and perform UIX tests.
- While we work on that, we will wait and see if the spike was a one-time thing, or if it continues to return.
